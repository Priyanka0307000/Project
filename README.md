## **ü§î What did I learn making this project ? ü§î**

- This project taught me intricate and peculiar use of positioning elements as well as features involving putting images on top of each other like a stack. It also focusses on the *Black/White* theme which taught me how using only two colors can make a webpage aesthetic.
